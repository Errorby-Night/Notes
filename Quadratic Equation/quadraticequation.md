# Theory of Quadratic Equation:

An equation ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0 is called a quadratic equation. Here a, b, c are the coefficients of the given equation. Suppose this equation has two roots p and q. Then,

p + q = -(b / a), and

p * q = c / a.

The discriminant D = b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac.

The roots of the given equation is given by the formula:

x = -b Â± $\sqrt{D}$ / 2a

## Nature of the roots:

1. If D > 0, the roots are real and distinct.
2. If D = 0, thr roots are real and equal.
3. If D < 0, the roots are imaginary.
4. If D is a perfect square, the roots are rational.

## Transformation of the equation:

If p and q are the roots of the equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$, then the equation whose roots are:
1. $1/p, 1/q$ is $cx^2 + bx + a = 0$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(Replace x by 1/x)
2. (-p, -q) is $ax^2 - bx + c=0$&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;(Replace x by -x)
3. (k+p, k+q) is $a(x-k)^2 + b(x-k) + c =0$&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;(Replace x by (x - k))
4. $p^n, q^n$ is a(x<sup>(1/n)</sup>)<sup>2</sup> + bx<sup>(1/n)</sup> + c = 0&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(Replace x by x<sup>(1/n)</sup>)
5. p<sup>(1/n)</sup>, q<sup>(1/n)</sup> is $a(x^n)^2 + bx^n + c = 0$&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;(Replace x by x<sup>(n)</sup>)
6. $kp, kq$ is $ax^2 + kbx + k^2 c = 0$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;(Replace x by x/k)
7. $p/k, q/k$ is $k^2 ax^2 + kbx + c = 0$&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(Replace x by kx)
