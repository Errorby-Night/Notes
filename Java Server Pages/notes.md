# Java Server Pages

## Introduction:

JSP is used to create web applications like the Servlet technology.
- It is kind of an extension to servlet.
- It is easier to maintain than a servlet.

## Advantages:

- Extension to servlet:
>> All the features of a servlet are available in JSP. In addition, we can use implicit objects, predefined tags and custom tags in JSP.

- Easy to maintain:
>> Separates our business and presentation logic.

- Faster deployment and development:
>> We don't need to recompile and redploy a JSP project again and again

- Less code than servlet:
>> We use custom tags in JSP, that significantly reduces the code.
